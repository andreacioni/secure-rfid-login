Secure RFID Login (SRL) by Andrea Cioni
=======================================

Login in your favourite site without type any sort of username/password and automatically!

SRL is an application that run on Windows OS, is based on libwebsocket (https://github.com/warmcat/libwebsockets) and released under the same license.

To compile and test you must have:<br>
  -Visual Studio C/C++ (I've used the 2010 Express Edition version for the test)<br>
  -libwebsocket-source (included in this package)<br>
  -cmake<br>
  -OpenSSL for Windows<br>
  -Arduino IDE<br>
  -Arduino Board<br>
  -RFID module (MFRC522 in this case)<br>
  -RFID library for MFRC522 (here https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid)<br>
  -Speaker, LED and other basic components (<b>OPTIONAL</b>)<br>
  -Addon SDK for Mozilla Firefox (here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation)<br>
